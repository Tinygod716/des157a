            <p class="question">
               1. Why and how is this image interesting? Tell us something we would not know by looking at the image alone. <br>
2. How does this image relate to the topic of your archive or collection? <br>
3. How does your collection or archive say something (i.e. tell a story) about you?
            </p>

                The focal point of this image is the eye of the snowman, partially covered in a way that feels intentional. The twist, however, is that while this figure appears slightly blurred, the snowmen in the background are more clearly in focus. This creates a subtle ambiguity, inviting the audience to question which figure is the true subject of the image. The human-like emotions and sentiments that the snowmen evoke make this photo intriguing.

            <p>
                I have an entire collection of photos titled "Me and the Snowmen," which I took a long time ago. I want to use the snowy weather and the architectural style as the emotional foundation for this project. In this series, the two "living" figures—myself and the snowmen—will form a connection that expresses a sense of playfulness and companionship, creating an atmosphere where I, as a living person, find companionship in an inanimate snowman.

            </p>

            <p>
                The theme behind this collection is the fleeting nature of time and the impermanence of objects. The philosophy underpinning it asks: if the snowmen and I become friends this winter, will we be able to see each other again next winter? Will you, my temporary companion, disappear after today? Or, why can’t you stay longer in my life?

                This photo shows a person standing next to a fashion model and doing a posture imitating the posture of that fashion model. He smiling at the camera and trying to make a model face as well. The whole atmosphere conveyed by the photo illustrator is a joyful feeling.

                This image captures an intriguing contrast between a mannequin and a person, both positioned closely in a clothing store. One of the most interesting aspects is the comparison between the mannequin's formal, coordinated outfit—complete with a blazer, trousers, and black shoes—and the casual attire of the individual standing beside it, who is dressed in a relaxed red t-shirt, striped shorts, and slippers.

              <p>
                The most obvious aspect of the image is the contrast in clothing and appearance between the mannequin and the person. The mannequin presents a polished, minimalist look, typical of retail displays, while the individual next to it appears laid-back, embodying an everyday, approachable style
